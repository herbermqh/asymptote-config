# Contents
My config directory contains packages from the following authors:
- Christophe Grospellier for `inequations_cg.asy`.
- G. Marris for `gm_probabilitytree.asy`, `gm_tableaux.asy` and `gm.asy`.
- Jens Schwaiger for `polyhedron_js` and `tube_js.asy`.
- Philippe Ivaldi for all files ending with `pi`.
- Mine for `lib_jl.asy`, which only use some of the previous packages.
